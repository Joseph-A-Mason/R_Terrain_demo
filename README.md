## R Scripts to Demonstrate Terrain and Soils Analysis and Visualization Tools in R

This repository contains a R script and related files to be used in Geography 475. Students will access the scripts through Binder. The script used here was written by Joe Mason using several R packages to visualize terrain data from DEMs and to obtain and visualize soil survey data. See comments in R script for more details. Will add citations here.
